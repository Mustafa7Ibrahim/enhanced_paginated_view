/// A widget that displays a paginated view in a box layout.
///
/// The [EnhancedBoxView] widget is used to display a paginated view in a box layout.
/// It takes a [delegate] that provides the necessary data and configuration for the view,
/// a [builder] function that builds the individual items in the view,
/// a [direction] that determines the scrolling direction of the view,
/// a [page] number that represents the current page of the view,
/// and a [scrollController] that controls the scrolling behavior of the view.
///
/// The [EnhancedBoxView] widget provides two factory constructors:
/// - [EnhancedBoxView] creates a forward scrolling view.
///
/// The [EnhancedBoxView] widget overrides the [build] method to build the view based on the [direction].
/// It internally calls either the [forwardBuild] or [reverseBuild] method to build the view accordingly.
///
/// The [forwardBuild] method builds the view with a forward scrolling direction.
/// It uses a [SingleChildScrollView] with a [Column] as its child.
/// The [delegate] provides the necessary configuration for the view,
/// and the [builder] function is used to build the individual items in the view.
///
/// The [reverseBuild] method builds the view with a reverse scrolling direction.
/// It uses a [SingleChildScrollView] with a [Column] as its child.
/// The [delegate] provides the necessary configuration for the view,
/// and the [builder] function is used to build the individual items in the view.
